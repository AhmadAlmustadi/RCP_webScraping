# **Armin Strom website scraping **



The data extracted from the website for watches generally appears to be of good quality, with few issues identified. here's what I found:

1. **Completeness**: 
   - We've got most of the details we need, like prices, descriptions, and brands etc..,. However, there are a few watches missing marketing names, and the specific model for watch 28 is totally off.

2. **Accuracy**:
   - We've made some fixes, like converting the German text for watch 34 and correcting the specific model for watch 28. But there might still be some issues lurking around.

3. **Consistency**:
   - This is a bit tricky. We couldn't extract the nickname alone, so it's bundled up in another category. Plus, the data in `<p>` tags and elsewhere might be a bit all over the place, making it hard to keep things consistent.

4. **Validity**:
   - While we've made improvements, there are still some gaps and inconsistencies that could affect the overall validity of the data.

5. **Timeliness**:
   - The data is as fresh as it gets, pulled straight from the website.

Overall, we've made some good progress in cleaning up the data, but there's still work to be done to ensure everything is accurate, complete, and consistent.
